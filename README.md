# Wifiibo - Wifi amiibo Management Tool
Wifiibo is a tool for managing an amiibo collection.  Using an ESP8266
(with the Arduino development environment) and an NFC reader, you can 
read & store existing amiibos, create new amiibos using amiibo data 
files, and view your amiibo data.  All amiibo data is stored on the flash 
memory of the ESP8266, so there's no need for additional storage 
hardware.  The whole thing is managed using any web browser!


The library that runs most of the amiibo functions is a port of 
[amiitool](https://github.com/socram8888/amiitool) for the ESP8266 using 
the Arduino environment.

## Features
* Save/back up existing amiibo
* Create new amiibos using data files (requires encryption keys)
* View your amiibo collection using any web browser (even on your phone!)

## Quickstart
**Step 1.** Flash an ESP8266 with the latest release found in the `releases/` folder. 

Using [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool):
```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1410 write_flash -fm dio 0x00000 Wifiibo_1.0.ino.d1_mini.bin
```

**Step 2.** Connect a PN532 NFC board to an ESP8266's SPI pins  
**Step 3.** Using a computer/phone connect to the *wifiibo* wireless network 
and browse to 192.168.4.1.

For more info see below.

## Getting Started

### Hardware
Wifiibo requires the following hardware:  

* ESP8266 ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471) ~10$, 
[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ESP8266-ESP12-ESP-12-WeMos-D1-Mini-WIFI-Dev-Kit-Development-Board-NodeMCU-Lua/32653918483.html) ~3$)
* PN532 NFC board ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/789)  ~40$ 
[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/PN532-NFC-RFID-Module-V3-Kits-Reader-Writer/32452824672.html) ~$5)

Remember to flip the DIP switches on the PN532 board to SPI mode.  On my board 
this was [ch1: ON, ch2: OFF] but this may vary.

Connect the PN532 board to the ESP8266's SPI interface.  This can vary from board 
to board and you should check the pinout of you specific ESP8266.  

PN532 Pin | ESP Pin
----------|----------
MOSI      | D7
MISO      | D6
SCK       | D5
SS        | D4
VCC       | +5V
GND       | GND



### Software Library Dependencies
Wifiibo depends on a number of additional Arduino libraries (which are only needed 
if you want to compile Wifiibo):  

* [EspAsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP) 
* [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)
* [Adafruit_PN532](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532)
  * A modified version of this library, Adafruit_PN532Ex, is included with Wifiibo
* [mbedtls](https://tls.mbed.org)
  * A modified version of this library is included with Wifiibo
  
### Compiling
In order to compile the Wifiibo software, you'll need the Arduino IDE.  Ensure you 
have the ESP8266 board support package installed (refer to 
[the main ESP8266 Arduino page](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) for instructions 
on setting it up).  Clone this repository into the 'libraries' folder in your Arduino 
sketch folder.  Open the Arduino IDE, and you'll find Wifiibo under the "Examples" menu,
 listed under the "amiitool" library.  After selecting your ESP8266 board in the IDE, 
 click the Upload button to flash Wifiibo to the ESP8266.  After the initial upload you'll
  want to upload the data directory as well, which contains some additional utilities and 
  the website favicon.

### Updating
If new software releases are made, they will show up in the "releases" folder.  To easily 
update your Wifiibo, download the latest release binary, then go to http://wifiibo.local/update. 
Select the "bin" file you downloaded, and click the "Update" button.  When updating is 
complete, the page will change to "OK."  Go back to http://wifiibo.local and verify that
the version number in the upper-right corner of the screen has been updated.

## Using Wifiibo
When Wifiibo starts, if your ESP8266 isn't connected to Wifi, it will start up its own 
hotspot called "Wifiibo."  Connect to the hotspot using your phone or computer, then open 
a web browser and go to http://192.168.4.1 to access Wifiibo.  Click on the "Configure Wifi" 
button, enter your Wifi network credentials, and click submit.

Once connected to Wifi, you can access Wifiibo by going to http://wifiibo.local in your browser.  
Alternatively, some routers will allow you to go to [http://wifiibo.](http://wifiibo.) 
(note the '.' at the end).  Tip: Once you get to the Wifiibo page, you can click on the IP 
in the top-right corner of the page.  Using the IP directly seems to be faster on some Windows 
computers.

In order for Wifiibo to read or write any amiibo tags, it needs the amiibo encryption keys. 
Click on the red button labeled "Upload keys" to import or upload your amiibo encryption keys. 
The keys file must be named "key_retail.bin".  Once you have successfully imported the amiibo 
encryption keys, the red "Upload keys" button will disappear.

Using Wifiibo is fairly straightforward.  amiibo data is pulled from the excellent 
[amiibo API](https://github.com/N3evin/AmiiboAPI) by @N3vin.
In order to write amiibo information to a tag, the tag must be type NTAG215 and
must be blank.

## Enclosure
If you have access to a 3D printer, you can print an enclosure for Wifiibo.  
The enclosure is in two halves, which press-fit together.  The lid piece will 
need to be printed upside-down and requires support material for the "inset" on 
the top.  The Wemos D1 Mini board can be press-fit into the base, and the PN532 
board can be screwed into the standoffs in the lid.  I made the standoffs slightly
smaller than the #4-40 screws I used, so I tapped the mounts using an inexpensive
 tapping tool.

## Developer Notes
* The main Wifiibo page is called amiitool.htm.  There's a batch script & accompanying 
executable that's used to gzip the page, then convert the binary into a C-style header
file so the page is embedded in the firmware.  This way, any future firmware updates 
will contain the updated web page (otherwise users would have to upload it separately).
* The main page (amiitool.htm) is pretty messy

### Possible Enhancements
* MFRC-522 NFC chip support
  * Pull requests welcome; ensure it implements the NFCInterface pure virtual class.
* Card emulation support using PN532
  * Not sure if this is possible- the documentation on the PN532 states that in emulation 
  mode, only 4-byte IDs are supported.  Might be able to supply raw page data to get it to work.
* SD card support
  * The amiitool library has some SD support (using the SdFat library for long filename support),
   but it has not been tested.
* The Wifi scan results JSON info in the main program might need to be changed from static to 
dynamic to handle a large number of results
